## Bristol

The first stop on our trip, we took the train from London Heathrow to the city and bussed to our hotel on the North West side of town. We arrived in the evening and were greeted by port and holiday pies.

We stayed at the Number 38 Clifton, a boutique bed and breakfast residing in an older Georgian townhouse with great views of the city. Our first and only full day was spent exploring the nearby area.
We took a walk through the Clifton Downs to the Clifton Observatory, where we spotted a familiar face, and then down the hill to cross the Clifton Suspension Bridge

Getting to explore parts of Bristol was wonderful, but we had really come to town for a more specific reason -- football! Miranda’s grandfather was born in Bristol and so we figured we could nab two birds with one stone - I could get my footie fix in and Miranda could experience some of her geographic heritage. We bought tickets for Bristol City vs Stoke City and given that I bought the tickets some several months in advance and Bristol City is not one of the major clubs, we were able to secure some fairly decent seats.

*Ashton Gate Stadium*

While managing to pull ahead in the first half, the home team let their lead slip and the night ended 2-1 Stoke City. We still had a great time, seeing the sport at this level in person and - arguably more impressive - the dueling fanbases! There was a real sense of pride and tribalism surrounding each city's team that I haven’t seen on this side of the pond. After the game we strolled across the main river to find ourselves some cozy chairs and warm mulled wine before heading back to the hotel where on a balcony we spotted the partner in crime of a certain cultural icon that we had seen earlier in the day.

The next morning was an early one, as we headed to the first station in our leapfrog day of travel. A taxi took us from the Number 38 to Bristol Temple Meads, where we would take a train to Paddington. After departing the train at Paddington and grabbing a flat white at a cafe, we hurried to our platform where we would take our connection to King's Cross, and finally board our train North to Edinburgh.
